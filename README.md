## Why JavaScript?

I chose JavaScript for my web development journey, particularly for backend development, due to its versatility and the ability to build dynamic web applications. JavaScript allows for seamless development across both client and server sides, making it an ideal choice for full-stack development.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub to store my projects.
   - Initialize the repository locally and set up Git for version control.

3. **Set Up Codespaces**:
   - Utilize GitHub Codespaces for a cloud-based development environment tailored for Node.js projects.
   - Troubleshoot any initial setup issues independently.

## My First Program

I wrote my first JavaScript program using Node.js:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Programmer");
